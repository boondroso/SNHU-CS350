# Milestone 3 & Final Project Reflection  

## Project Overview  

This project focused on developing a temperature and humidity monitoring system using a **Raspberry Pi**, **AHT20 sensor**, and **16x2 LCD display**.  
The main goal was to simulate the core functionality of a smart thermostat—collecting real-time environmental data and displaying it clearly to the user.

## Milestone 3 – Summary  

### Summary and Problem Solved  
Milestone 3 involved connecting the temperature and humidity sensor to the Raspberry Pi and displaying the readings on the LCD.  
This solved the problem of integrating hardware and software to create a real-time monitoring system for environmental conditions.  

### What I Did Well  
- Successfully wired and tested all components before full integration.  
- Wrote clean, functional Python code to read and display sensor data.  
- Ensured reliable I²C communication between the Pi and the peripherals.  

### Where I Could Improve  
- Plan the circuit layout earlier to avoid rewiring later on.  
- Create a more detailed wiring diagram before building.  

### Tools and Resources Added to My Support Network  
- **Raspberry Pi documentation** and **Adafruit sensor library**  
- **Stack Overflow** and maker forums for troubleshooting  
- **Thonny IDE** for step-by-step code testing  

### Transferable Skills  
- Python scripting and modular code design  
- Understanding I²C communication and sensor data handling  
- Hardware debugging and breadboard prototyping  

### Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability  
- Used clear variable names and consistent code structure.  
- Added inline comments explaining each function’s role.  
- Organized code into setup, read, and display sections for easier updates.

## Final Project – Smart Thermostat Prototype  

### Summary and Problem Solved  
The final project expanded on Milestone 3 to create a **functional thermostat prototype** capable of adjusting system states (Idle, Heating, Cooling) based on temperature input.  
This project addressed the challenge of combining multiple components—sensor, display, and logic—into one cohesive embedded system.  

### What I Did Well  
- Implemented a **state machine** to handle different operating modes.  
- Wrote organized, commented code that clearly explained logic flow.  
- Improved physical layout and wire management for cleaner connections.  

### Where I Could Improve  
- Add Wi-Fi/cloud connectivity to store or view temperature data remotely.  
- Expand the interface to include user input for temperature thresholds.  

### Tools and Resources Added to My Support Network  
- **GitHub** for version control and project documentation.  
- **Raspberry Pi OS Terminal** and **Linux commands** for system management.  
- Online IoT and embedded systems communities for continued learning.  

### Transferable Skills  
- Experience with hardware-software integration and embedded systems.  
- State machine design for logical process control.  
- Version control practices and organized workflow using Git.  
- Debugging techniques applicable to future IoT and automation projects.  

### Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability  
- Modularized code using functions for each system task.  
- Commented each section to explain logic and transitions between states.  
- Designed the state machine for easy expansion (e.g., more sensors or outputs).  
- Used consistent naming conventions and docstrings for clarity.

## Overall Reflection  

This course and these projects taught me how to plan, design, and implement real-world embedded systems.  
The combination of coding, hardware integration, and structured testing gave me valuable hands-on experience in system design, troubleshooting, and documentation.  
These are skills I can directly apply to future IoT and emerging technology projects.
